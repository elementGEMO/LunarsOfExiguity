<br> - Spawn Every # Stage in a Loop
<br> - Spawn After # Stages

- Added a condition to ``Relic of Glass`` to prevent extremely small health that allows taking damage without dying
- ``Relic of Purity`` now sets proc-coefficient to an extremely small number, letting Survivors apply their status effects normally
<br> Default stat increases are now decreased due to allowing some items to function as well
- Fixed ``Relic of Focus`` not properly dealing damage sometimes
- Fixed ``Relic of Focus`` disabling an important variable that others use, notably ``Abstracted Locus`` from ``BubbetsItems``
