## Lunars of Exiguity

A small content mod that focuses on enhancing, and overhauling all of the ``Risk of Rain 2 Lunar`` items as well as creating a new tier called ``Purified`` to mirror these new Lunars and adding more content towards the ``Cleansing Pool``.
<br>- Made by **Gemo** ``@noodlegemo``
###### This mod is highly configurable! <sub><sup> Except Lunar / Purified anti-stacking </sub></sup>
### Lunar Changes
A significant change with this mod is that ``Lunars`` no longer have the ability to stack, and are purely focused on drastically changing the playstyle of a single ``Lunar``. This anti-stacking feature also should work with other ``Lunar`` items from other mods, however, those items will still retain their stacking item information.

### Purified Tier
``Purified`` items also follow suit and do not stack. ``Purified`` items are also heavily inspired off of the perspective of ``Providence``, as similar as ``Lunars`` are usually from ``Mithrix``. ``Purified`` items also ``Fracture`` their ``Lunar`` counterpart, essentially destroying the ``Lunar``.

| ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/riskofrain2_gamepedia_en/images/a/ae/Brittle_Crown.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/64?cb=20200129193030) | Relic of Greed | You can buy everything... **BUT you can go into debt, increasing damage taken**. | Money goes negative properly. |

| ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/riskofrain2_gamepedia_en/images/b/b1/Stone_Flux_Pauldron.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/64?cb=20220302095820) | Relic of Acromegaly | Taking damage causes you to grow, increasing armor and **reducing speed**. | Realistically reduces speed up to ``99.9%``, instead of ``100%``. |
| ![](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/riskofrain2_gamepedia_en/images/a/a2/Purity.png/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/64?cb=20200811165022) | Relic of Purity | Increase ALL of your stats, and skills have NO cooldowns... **BUT you have no proc-coefficients**. | ``Crit`` can no longer activate, and ignores the hidden ``0.5s`` cooldown. |
